    <title>Introduction to Systems of Linear Equations</title>

    <p>
        You are probably familiar with the concept of a <term>system of linear equations</term> and with some methods for solving such systems.  
        In this section, we will look at the algebra and geometry of finding and interpreting solutions of systems of linear equations.  
        We will start with two-variable and three-variable systems, then move on to systems involving more variables.

        <p>
            When you were first introduced to systems of equations, you learned to solve for one variable in terms of the other(s), then substitute.  
            Here, we will introduce another method.  
            This alternative method, called <term>Gaussian elimination</term>, involves adding multiples of one equation to another equation in order to eliminate one of the variables.  
            This method will form the foundation for an algorithm we will develop for solving linear systems and performing other computations related to systems. 
            Let's explore this in <xref ref="init-systwoeqs1"/>.

                This problem formalizes what you may already know (perhaps under a different name) about <term>elementary row operations</term> as means of solving systems of linear equations.  Consider the system
                <me>
                    \begin{matrix}
                    2x\amp   -\amp   y\amp  =\amp  -4\\
                    3x \amp   +\amp   2y\amp  = \amp   1 
                    \end{matrix}
                </me>
                We will begin by adding twice the first row to the second row, and replacing the second row with the sum. 
                <me>
                    R_2+2R_1\rightarrow R_2
                </me>
                <me>
                    \begin{matrix}
                    2x\amp   -\amp   y\amp  =\amp   -4\\
                    7x \amp   +\amp   0y\amp  = \amp   -7  
                    \end{matrix}
                </me>
        
                Note that this step eliminates <m>y</m> from the second equation.  
        
                Next we multiply both sides of the second equation by <m>\frac{1}{7}</m>. 
                <me>
                    \frac{1}{7}R_2\rightarrow R_2
                </me>
        
        
                <me>
                    \begin{matrix}
                    2x\amp   - \amp   y\amp  =\amp  -4\\
                    x \amp   \amp  \amp  = \amp   -1
                    \end{matrix}
                </me>
        
                
                We now know <m>x=-1</m>.  Our next goal is to determine <m>y</m> by eliminating <m>x</m> from the first equation.  To this end, we subtract twice the second row from the first row and replace the first row with the difference. 
                <me>
                    R_1-2R_2\rightarrow R_1
                </me>
        
        
        
                <me>
                    \begin{matrix}
                    0x\amp   -\amp   y\amp  =\amp   -2\\
                    x \amp   \amp  \amp  = \amp  -1 \\
                    \end{matrix}
                </me>
        
        
                Next we multiply both sides of the first equation by <m>-1</m>. 
                <me>
                    -R_1\rightarrow R_1
                </me>
        
        
                <me>
                    \begin{matrix}
                    \amp    \amp   y\amp  =\amp  2\\
                    x \amp   \amp  \amp  = \amp  -1
                    \end{matrix}
                </me>
        
                
                    
                Finally, we can switch the order of equations in order to display <m>x</m> in the top row. 
                <me>
                    R_1\leftrightarrow R_2
                </me>
                
        
        
                <me>
                    \begin{matrix}
                    x \amp   \amp  \amp  = \amp  -1\\
                    \amp    \amp   y\amp  =\amp  2      
                    \end{matrix}
                </me>
        
                
                This solution can be written as an ordered pair <m>(-1, 2)</m>.

            As we applied elementary row operations to the system in <xref ref="init-systwoeqs1"/>, the system changed, but a quick check will convince you that all six systems have the same solution: <m>(-1, 2)</m>.  The six systems are said to be <term>equivalent</term>.  
        </p>

        <p>
            It turns out that if a system of equations is transformed into another system through a sequence of elementary row operations, the new system will be equivalent to the original system, in other words, both systems will have the same solution(s).  We will formalize this statement as <xref ref="th-elemRowOpsEquivSys"/> at the end of this section.

                <p>
            It may be daunting to think about how to begin.  But keep in mind the desired end-result.  What we want is to use elementary row operations to transform the given system into something like this
        
        <me>
            \begin{array}{ccccccc}
              x \amp   \amp  \amp  \amp  \amp  = \amp   a \\
             \amp    \amp   y\amp  \amp  \amp  =\amp   b\\
             \amp   \amp  \amp  \amp   z\amp  =\amp   c
            \end{array}
        </me>
        
            
        We will accomplish this by using a convenient variable in one row to ``wipe out" this variable from the other two rows.  For example, we can use <m>x</m> in the third equation to wipe out <m>3x</m> in the first equation and <m>2x</m> in the second equation.  To do this, multiply the third row by <m>-3</m> and add it to the top row, then multiply the third row by <m>-2</m> and add it to the second row.  We now have:
        
        <me>
            \begin{array}{c}
         \xrightarrow{R_1-3R_3}\\
         \xrightarrow{R_2-2R_3}\\
        \\
         \end{array}
         \begin{array}{ccccccc}
              0x \amp   -\amp  13y\amp  +\amp  7z\amp  = \amp  -33 \\
             0x\amp   -\amp  7y\amp  +\amp  6z\amp  =\amp  -20\\
             x\amp   +\amp  4y\amp  -\amp  2z\amp  =\amp  11
            \end{array}
        </me>
        
        In the previous step <m>x</m> was a convenient variable to use because the coefficient in front of <m>x</m> was 1.  We no longer have a variable with coefficient 1.  We could create a coefficient of 1 using division, but that would lead to fractions, making computations cumbersome.  Instead, we will subtract twice the second row from the first row. This gives us:
        
        
        <me>
            \begin{array}{c}
         \xrightarrow{R_1-2R_2}\\
         \\
        \\
         \end{array}
         \begin{array}{ccccccc}
              0x \amp  +  \amp   y\amp  -\amp  5z\amp  = \amp  7 \\
             0x\amp   -\amp  7y\amp  +\amp  6z\amp  =\amp  -20\\
             x\amp   +\amp  4y\amp  -\amp  2z\amp  =\amp  11
            \end{array}
        </me>
        
        
        Next we add seven times the first row to the second row, and subtract four times the first row from the third row. 
        
        
        <me>
            \begin{array}{c}
         \\
         \xrightarrow{R_2+7R_1}\\
        \xrightarrow{R_3-4R_1}\\
         \end{array}
         \begin{array}{ccccccc}
              0x \amp   + \amp   y\amp  -\amp  5z\amp  = \amp  7 \\
             0x\amp   +\amp  0y\amp  -\amp  29z\amp  =\amp  29\\
             x\amp   +\amp  0y\amp  +\amp  18z\amp  =\amp  -17
            \end{array}
        </me>
        
            
            Now we divide both sides of the second row by <m>-29</m>.
            
            
        <me>
            
            \begin{array}{c}
            \\
         \xrightarrow{-\frac{1}{29}R_2}\\
        \\
         \end{array}
         \begin{array}{ccccccc}
              0x \amp   + \amp   y\amp  -\amp  5z\amp  = \amp  7 \\
             0x\amp   +\amp  0y\amp  +\amp  z\amp  =\amp  -1\\
             x\amp   +\amp  0y\amp  +\amp  18z\amp  =\amp  -17
            \end{array}
        </me>
        
            
            Adding <m>5</m> times the second row to the first row and subtracting <m>18</m> times the second row from the third row gives us
            
            
        <me>
            \begin{array}{c}
         \xrightarrow{R_1+5R_2}\\
         \\
        \xrightarrow{R_3-18R_2}\\
         \end{array}
         \begin{array}{ccccccc}
              0x \amp   + \amp   y\amp  +\amp  0z\amp  = \amp  2 \\
             0x\amp   +\amp  0y\amp  +\amp  z\amp  =\amp  -1\\
             x\amp   +\amp  0y\amp  +\amp  0z\amp  =\amp  1
            \end{array}
        </me>
        
        
        Finally, rearranging the rows gives us
        
        
        <me>
            \begin{array}{ccccccc}
             x\amp   +\amp  0y\amp  +\amp  0z\amp  =\amp  1\\
             0x \amp   + \amp   y\amp  +\amp  0z\amp  = \amp  2 \\
             0x\amp   +\amp  0y\amp  +\amp  z\amp  =\amp  -1
             \end{array}
        </me>
        
             
         
        <me>
            \begin{array}{ccccccc}
             x\amp   \amp  \amp  \amp  \amp  =\amp  1\\
              \amp    \amp   y\amp  \amp  \amp  = \amp  2 \\
             \amp  \amp  \amp  \amp  z\amp  =\amp  -1
             \end{array}
        </me>
            
             
        Thus the system has a unique solution <m>(1, 2, -1)</m>.
                </p>
            </answer>
        </example>
        
        <p>
        At this point you may be wondering whether it will always be possible to take a system of three equations and three unknowns and use elementary row operations to transform it to a system of the form
        <me>
            \begin{array}{ccccccc}
              x \amp   \amp  \amp  \amp  \amp  = \amp  a \\
             \amp    \amp   y\amp  \amp  \amp  = \amp   b\\
             \amp   \amp  \amp  \amp  z\amp  =\amp  c
            \end{array}
        </me>
        The short answer to this question is NO.  The existence of an equivalent system of this form implies that the original system has a unique solution <m>(a, b, c)</m>.  However, it is possible for a system to have no solutions or to have infinitely many solutions.  We will study these different possibilities from an algebraic perspective in subsequent sections.  For now, we will attempt to gain insight into existence and uniqueness of solutions through geometry.

             We have to keep in mind that given an arbitrary system, an equivalent system of this form may not exist (we will talk a lot more about this later).  However, it does exist in this case, and we would like to find a more efficient way of getting to it than having to write and rewrite our equations at each step.

                    \end{array}
                </me>
                can be written in the <term>augmented matrix form</term> as follows:

                The array to the left of the vertical bar is called the <term>coefficient matrix</term> of the linear system and is often given a capital letter name, like <m>A</m>.  The vertical array to the right of the bar is called a <term>constant vector</term>.

                The <term>dimension of a matrix</term> with <m>m</m> rows and <m>n</m> columns is <m>m\times n</m>, 
                read <q><m>m</m> by <m>n</m>.</q> Hence, in <xref ref="init-augmentedmatrixex"/>, the dimension of the

                is <m>4\times 1</m>, and the dimension of the augmented matrix is <m>4\times 5</m>.

            <p>
                We will sometimes use the following notation to represent an augmented matrix.

                The same elementary row operations that we perform on a system of equations can be performed on the corresponding augmented matrix, or any matrix for that matter. 
                If a matrix can be obtained from another matrix by means of elementary row operations, we say that the two matrices are <term>row-equivalent</term>.

            Recall that in <xref ref="init-augmentedmatrixex"/> we converted the given system to an augmented matrix form, then performed elementary row operations until we arrived at a ``convenient" form.

            The augmented matrix in <xref ref="eq-sys20reducedrowechelon"/> has the same convenient form as the one in <xref ref="eq-sys20rref"/>.  This augmented matrix corresponds to the system

            This gives us the solution <m>(\frac{1}{2}, -\frac{13}{2}, 2)</m>.

            While the augmented matrix in <xref ref="eq-sys20reducedrowechelon"/> was certainly ``convenient", we could have converted back to the equation format a little earlier.  Let's take a look at the augmented matrix in <xref ref="eq-sys20rowechelon"/>.  Converting <xref ref="eq-sys20rowechelon"/> to a system of equations gives us

            Substituting <m>x_3=2</m> into the second equation and solving for <m>x_2</m> gives us

                x_2=\frac{-3-5(2)}{2}=-\frac{13}{2}
            </me>
              Now substituting <m>x_3=2</m> and <m>x_2=-\frac{13}{2}</m> into the first equation results in 
            <me>
                x_1=1+\left(-\frac{13}{2}\right)+3(2)=\frac{1}{2}

            Observe that the coefficient matrices in <xref ref="eq-sys20rref"/> and <xref ref="eq-sys20reducedrowechelon"/> have the same format: 1's along the diagonal, zeros above and below the 1's.  The other ``convenient" format, exhibited by the coefficient matrix in <xref ref="eq-sys20rowechelon"/>,  also has zeros below the diagonal, but not all of the diagonal entries are 1's and some of the entries above the diagonal are not zero.  Each of these formats gives rise to a definition.  These definitions are the topic of the next section.

            Geometrically, the graph of each equation is a line in <m>\R^2</m>.  The point <m>(-1, 2)</m> is a solution to both equations, so it must lie on both lines.
            The graph below shows the two lines intersecting at <m>(-1, 2)</m>.

            Unlike the situation in <xref ref="ex-systwoeqs2"/>, any combination of <m>x</m> and <m>y</m> satisfies the second equation.  So, any ordered pair <m>(x, y)</m> that satisfies the first equation will satisfy the second equation.  Thus, the solution set for this system is the same as the set of all solutions of <m>4x+3y=2</m>.

        <p>
            In <xref ref="ex-threeeqthreevars1"/>, we solved the following linear system of three equations and three unknowns
            <me>
                \begin{array}{ccccccc}
                  3x \amp   - \amp   y\amp  +\amp  z\amp  = \amp  0 \\
                 2x\amp   + \amp   y\amp  +\amp  2z\amp  =\amp  2\\
                 x\amp   +\amp  4y\amp  -\amp  2z\amp  =\amp  11
                \end{array}
            </me>
            We found that the system has a unique solution <m>(1, 2, -1)</m>.  The graph of each equation is a plane.  The three planes intersect at a single point, as shown in the figure.

            Given a linear system of three equations in three variables, there are three ways in which the system can be consistent.
            <ul>
            <li>
                <p>
                    First, the three planes could intersect at a single point, giving us a unique solution.

                    Second, the three planes can intersect in a line, forming a paddle-wheel shape.  In this case, every point along the line of intersection is a solution to the system, giving us infinitely many solutions.

                    <p> 
                        Clearly, the order of equations does not affect the solution set, so <xref ref="item-rowswap"/> produces an equivalent system.  Next, you learned years ago that multiplying both sides of an equation by a non-zero constant does not change its solution set, which establishes that <xref ref="item-constantmult"/> produces an equivalent system.  To see that <xref ref="item-addrow"/> produces an equivalent system, note that if we add a multiple of an equation to another equation in the system, we are adding the same thing to both sides, which does not change the solution set of that equation, nor of the system.
