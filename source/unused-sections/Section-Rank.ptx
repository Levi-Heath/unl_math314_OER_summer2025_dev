        This section is an adaptation of Section 1.2 of Keith Nicholson's <url href="https://open.umn.edu/opentextbooks/textbooks/linear-algebra-with-applications"><em>*Linear Algebra with Applications*</em></url>.

        <p>

        As stated in <xref ref="th-uniquenessofrref"/>, the reduced row-echelon form of a matrix <m>A</m> is uniquely determined by <m>A</m>. That is, no matter which series of row operations is used to transform <m>A</m> to its reduced row-echelon matrix, the result will always be the same matrix. In contrast, this is not true for row-echelon matrices: different sequences of row operations can transform the same matrix <m>A</m> to different row-echelon matrices. However, it is true that the number <m>r</m> of nonzero rows must be the same in each of these row-echelon matrices, as we will see in Theorem <xref ref="th-dimofrowA"/>. Hence, the number <m>r</m> depends only on <m>A</m> and not on the way in which <m>A</m> is carried to row-echelon form.

        </p>

        <example xml:id="ex-rowechofA">

        <p>

        Matrices <xref ref="eq-ref1"/> and <xref ref="eq-ref2"/> of <xref ref="init-gaussianelim1"/> are both row-echelon forms of <m>A</m>.  Both matrices have three nonzero rows.  The same is true for <m>\mbox{rref}(A)</m>.

        </p>

        </example>

        <definition xml:id="def-rankofamatrix">

        <statement>

        <p>

        The <term>rank</term> of matrix <m>A</m>, denoted by <m>\mbox{rank}(A)</m>,

        is the number of nonzero rows that remain after we reduce <m>A</m> to row-echelon form by elementary row operations.

        </p>

        </statement>

        <p>

        The rank a notion connected closely to the existence of solutions and other more nuanced notions emerging later on. We provide an example on how to compute it.

        </p>

        <example xml:id="ex-rankofA1">

        <statement>

        <p>

        Compute the rank of

        <me>

        A =

        \begin{bmatrix}

        1 \amp  1 \amp  -1 \amp  4 \\

        2 \amp  1 \amp   3 \amp  0 \\

        0 \amp  1 \amp  -5 \amp  8

        \end{bmatrix}

        </me>

        </p>

        </statement>

        <answer>

        <p>

        A reduction of <m>A</m> to row-echelon form is

        <me>

        A =

        \begin{bmatrix}

        1 \amp  1 \amp  -1 \amp  4 \\

        2 \amp  1 \amp   3 \amp  0 \\

        0 \amp  1 \amp  -5 \amp  8

        \end{bmatrix} \rightsquigarrow\begin{bmatrix}

        1 \amp  1 \amp  -1 \amp  4 \\

        0 \amp  -1 \amp   5 \amp  -8 \\

        0 \amp   0 \amp  0 \amp  0

        \end{bmatrix}

        </me>

        Because the row-echelon form has two nonzero rows, <m>\mbox{rank}(A) = 2</m>.

        </p>

        </answer>

        <theorem xml:id="th-rankandsolutions">

        <statement>

        <p>

        Suppose a system of <m>m</m> equations in <m>n</m> variables is consistent, and that the rank of the <em>*coefficient*</em> matrix is <m>r</m>.

        <ol>

        <li>

        <p> The set of solutions involves exactly <m>n - r</m> parameters, corresponding to <m>n-r</m> free variables. </p>

        </li>

        <li>

        <p> If <m>r \lt  n</m>, the system has infinitely many solutions. </p>

        </li>

        <li>

        <p> If <m>r = n</m>, the system has a unique solution. </p>

        </li>

        </ol>

        </p>

        </statement>

        <proof>

        <p>

        The fact that the rank of the coefficient matrix is <m>r</m> means that there are exactly <m>r</m> leading variables in the coefficient matrix, and hence exactly <m>n - r</m> nonleading variables. The nonleading variables are called free variables.  All free variables are assigned parameters, so the set of solutions involves exactly <m>n - r</m> parameters. Hence if <m>r \lt  n</m>, there is at least one parameter, and so infinitely many solutions. If <m>r = n</m>, there are no parameters and the resulting solution is unique.

        </p>

        </proof>

        </theorem>

        <p>

        <xref ref="th-rankandsolutions"/> shows that, for any system of linear equations, exactly three possibilities exist:

        <ol>

        <li>

        <p> Unique solution. This occurs when every variable is a leading variable. </p>

        </li>

        <li>

        <p> Infinitely many solutions. This occurs when the system is consistent and there is at least one nonleading variable, so at least one parameter is involved. </p>

        </li>

        <li>

        <p> No solution.  This occurs when a row <m>\left[\begin{array}{cccc|c}  0\amp 0\amp \ldots \amp 0\amp 1 \end{array}\right]</m> appears in the row-echelon form. Such a row corresponds to an equation with no solutions. (See <xref ref="ex-nosolutionssys"/>.) </p>

        </li>

        </ol>
